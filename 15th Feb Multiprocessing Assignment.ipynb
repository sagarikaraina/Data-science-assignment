    "* Multiprocessing is a module that allows to run multiple processes in parallel to execute tasks in a faster and more efficient way. \n",
    "* It allows us to take advantage of multiple CPU cores to perform concurrent execution of tasks.\n",
    "* It reduces the overall processing time and increase the performance of application.\n",
    "* Multiprocessing also helps avoid issues such as deadlocks and race conditions, which can occur when multiple threads or processes try to access the same resources concurrently. By isolating different parts of program in separate processes, we can ensure that they don't interfere with each other and that they can continue running even if one of them encounters an error or crashes."

    "1. Processes vs. Threads: Multiprocessing creates separate processes, whereas multithreading creates separate threads within a process. Each process has its own memory space, whereas all threads share the same memory space.\n",
    "2. Resource Allocation: Multiprocessing requires more system resources (such as memory) than multithreading because each process has its own memory space. In contrast, multithreading can be more efficient in terms of resource usage because threads share the same memory space.\n",
    "3. Parallelism: Multiprocessing can achieve true parallelism because processes can run on separate CPU cores. In contrast, multithreading achieves concurrency but not necessarily parallelism, because threads run on the same CPU core and are executed in a time-sliced manner.\n",
    "4. Communication: Inter-process communication (IPC) is required for communication between processes, whereas inter-thread communication (ITC) can be achieved more easily through shared memory.\n",
    "5. Complexity: Multiprocessing is generally more complex to use than multithreading because it involves coordinating multiple processes and managing IPC. In contrast, multithreading is simpler to use because threads share the same memory space and ITC is easier to implement."

Instead of running these tasks sequentially on a single CPU core, a pool can distribute them across multiple CPU cores, allowing them to be executed in parallel and potentially reducing the overall processing time."
